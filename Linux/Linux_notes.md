# Linux Notes: 

#### Cron
A CronJob creates Jobs on a repeating schedule.

CronJob is meant for performing regular scheduled actions such as backups, report generation, and so on. One CronJob object is like one line of a crontab (cron table) file on a Unix system. It runs a Job periodically on a given schedule, written in Cron format.

#### Partition:
A partition is a way to divide a disk into multiple sections, each of which can be used to  
store files. Partitions are useful for organizing data on a disk and for improving performance.


#### Partitioning:
Partitioning means to divide a single hard drive into many logical drives.

#### Attributes of the file system:
1) inode number
2) file name
3) data block


#### What is Journaling?

It is a dedicated area in the file system where all the changes are tracked when the system crashed. So the possibilities of the file system corruption or crashes is less. 

#### Zombie:
The linux proces is still active in the process table, but it has stopped.
