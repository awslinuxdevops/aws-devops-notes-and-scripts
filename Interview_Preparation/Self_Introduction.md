## Professional 10 Years Self - Introduction: 

Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity. My name is Gurumurthy, and I bring around *10 years of IT experience,* out of which the last *6 years have been focused on AWS Cloud and DevOps practices.*

I started my career as a *Project Associate,* where I worked on server provisioning, patching, user management, and troubleshooting system-level issues. This gave me a very strong foundation in *infrastructure management and automation.*

Over the last *6 years,* I transitioned into *AWS Cloud and DevOps,* where I have designed and managed *cloud-native and hybrid infrastructures.* My expertise includes *AWS services* such as *VPC, EC2, S3, RDS, SNS, EKS, ECS, and ECR* for building scalable and secure environments.

On the *DevOps side,* I have strong hands-on experience with:

*CI/CD:* Jenkins and GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deployments.

*Containerization & Orchestration:* Docker and Kubernetes for microservices.

*Infrastructure as Code:* Terraform and Ansible to standardize and automate infrastructure deployments.

*Version Control & Collaboration:* Git and GitHub for branching strategies and automation.

In terms of *projects,* I have contributed to multiple enterprise applications such as *MrYoda, LabSquire, MicroGen, DLW, and Pharmacy Reports.* In these projects, I have been responsible for *setting up AWS cloud environments, implementing CI/CD pipelines, automating provisioning with Terraform and Ansible, and containerizing applications with Docker & Kubernetes.*

My key strengths include *automation, scalability, and reliability,* and I always focus on improving delivery speed while ensuring system stability and security. I am now looking for a role where I can bring my *end-to-end DevOps expertise,* mentor teams, and help organizations build *resilient cloud-native solutions."*
